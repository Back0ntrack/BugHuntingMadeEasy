CSRF is a client-side vulnerability which falls under Broken Access Control because it occurs when the server blindly trusts a user’s active session and processes sensitive actions—such as changing settings, updating data, or performing transactions—without verifying that the request was deliberately initiated by the authenticated user and not triggered by a malicious third-party website.
