# Business Logic Vulnerability

A business logic vulnerability is a flaw in the application's design that allows attackers to exploit legitimate workflows in unintended ways, often bypassing security controls without triggering technical alerts.

For example, they might be able to complete a transaction without going through the intended purchase workflow.

> _By passing unexpected values into server-side logic, an attacker can potentially induce the application to do something that it isn't supposed to._

## Ways to exploit

* _Direct Parameter tampering and bypassing front-end validation using Burp Suite._
* _Exploiting Inadequate Validation of Cart Calculations and Item Quantities (negative can be added) in E-Commerce Logic._
* _Bypassing Email Domain Validation to Escalate Privileges via Insecure Profile Update Logic._
* _Exploiting Integer Overflow via Excessive Item Quantities (add all possible number of quantities) to Turn Cart Total Negative and Bypass Payment Validation_

> **Background Logic**
>
> This vulnerability occurs due to **integer overflow**, a common issue in programming when numerical calculations exceed the maximum value that a variable type (such as a 32-bit signed integer) can store.
>
> In this case, the price of each item (e.g., a leather jacket priced at $1337 or 133700 cents) is multiplied by the quantity added to the cart. When the total price exceeds **2,147,483,647** (the maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer), it "overflows" and wraps around to the minimum negative value, **-2,147,483,648**. From there, it continues increasing as more items are added, but now the value is negative.
>
> Since the backend does not validate for negative totals, this leads to a **business logic flaw** where an attacker can bring the cart total into a small or even affordable negative range (e.g., between $0 and $100 of available store credit), and complete the purchase for far less than the actual cost.

* _Whenever you face restrictions on email domains or similar string formats, always try injecting long or padded inputs (up to 255 characters) to check for truncation-based bypasses._
* _Bypassing Password Change Validation by Omitting Current Password Field._&#x20;
* _Manipulating Server Responses to Falsely Confirm High-Value Purchases Without Deducting Wallet Balance_
* _Bypassing Role Selection Flow to Access Restricted Accounts via Unvalidated Redirect Manipulation_

> The application redirected authenticated users to a role selection page after login. By intercepting and modifying the redirect response to point directly to a sensitive endpoint (e.g., `/my-account?id=administrator`), I was able to bypass the intended role selection flow and access restricted account data. This occurred because the application failed to validate or restrict redirect targets during the post-login process.
