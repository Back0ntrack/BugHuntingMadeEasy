# Backend

Backend development focuses on the server-side of web applications, handling logic, data, and server operations that power the frontend. It involves everything that happens behind the scenes to make a website or app functional, such as processing requests, managing databases, and ensuring security. Below is a concise overview of what backend development covers, excluding historical details or deep explanations, as per your preference.

#### Backend Development Components

1. **Server-Side Programming Languages**:
   * **Common Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring), Ruby (Rails), PHP (Laravel), Go, C# (.NET).
   * **Purpose**: Handle business logic, process requests, generate dynamic content, and interact with databases.
2. **Web Servers**:
   * **Software**: Nginx, Apache, Express.js (Node.js), Tomcat, IIS.
   * **Function**: Receive HTTP requests, route them to appropriate handlers, and send responses to clients.
3. **Databases**:
   * **Relational**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle.
     * Structured data with tables, SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
     * Relationships (primary/foreign keys).
   * **NoSQL**: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB.
     * Handle unstructured/semi-structured data (documents, key-value, graphs).
   * **ORMs/ODMs**: Object-Relational Mapping (e.g., Sequelize, Hibernate, Mongoose) for easier database interaction.
4. **APIs**:
   * **Types**: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, WebSockets.
   * **Purpose**: Enable communication between frontend and backend or between services.
   * **Endpoints**: Routes (e.g., /users, /products) for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   * **Formats**: JSON, XML.
5. **Server-Side Frameworks**:
   * **Examples**: Express.js (Node.js), Django/Flask (Python), Spring Boot (Java), Ruby on Rails, Laravel (PHP).
   * **Features**: Routing, middleware, templating, authentication, database integration.
