## HTML

The first and most dominant component of the front end of web applications is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). It contains each page's basic elements, including titles, forms, images, and many other elements.

A very basic example of HTML page:&#x20;

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>A Heading</h1>
        <p>A Paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
